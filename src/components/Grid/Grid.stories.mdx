# Grid Component

## The Grid component adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts.

The Grid component is re-exported from MaterialUI. More details may be found on their [documentation](https://material-ui.com/components/grid/).

The grid creates visual consistency between layouts while allowing flexibility across a wide variety of designs and is based on a 12-column grid layout.

### Basic

```jsx
import { Grid } from '@flatironschool/ui'

export YourComponent = (): JSX.Element => (
  <Grid container alignItems="center" justify="center" spacing={2}>
    <Grid item xs={4} sm={3}>
      Left Side
    </Grid>

    <Grid item xs={5} sm={9}>
      Right Side
    </Grid>
  </Grid>
)
```

## Custom Styling of Grid Components

This ensures that only the expected props are passed to `Grid`.

```jsx
import { Grid } from '@flatironschool/ui'

const StyledFooter = styled(({ background, foreground, ...rest }) => <Grid container component="footer" alignItems="center" justify="center" {...rest} />)`
  background-color: ${background};
  color: ${foreground};
  max-height: 100px;
`

export YourComponent = (): JSX.Element => (
  <StyledFooter xs={12}>
    <p>Left side</p>
    <p>Right side</p>
  </StyledFooter>
)
```
